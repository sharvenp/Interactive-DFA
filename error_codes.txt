Error Code 0:
The DFA drawn is not a valid dfa. Consider checking the states and the transitions to ensure that it is in a valid form.

Error Code 1:
String contains alphabets that are not defined in the set of alphabets. It is also possible that the DFA has transitions on symbols which are not defined in the alphabet.

Error Code 2:
The states in the DFA do not have transitions for all the alphabets in the given alphabet. Check your state transitions and whether the given alphabet is a sequence of symbols with no spaces (must contain no other characters other than the transition symbols).

Error Code 3:
A state has multiple transitions for the same symbol. Please note that this app allows DFA's to be drawn and not NFA's.

Error Code 4:
There are no accepting states.
